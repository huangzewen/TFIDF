TFIDF
=====

(term frequency inverse document frequency) is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.It is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, which helps to control for the fact that some words are generally more common than others.
